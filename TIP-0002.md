## Abstract

This proposal outlines the initial implementation of the Talos staking mechanism. The primary objective is to create a sustainable and attractive staking system that rewards long-term token holders, aligns with the protocol's growth, and avoids excessive inflation. This proposal integrates feedback from the Talos Council to establish a balanced approach that starts with a dynamic APY, incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism, and lays the groundwork for future dividend-style rewards.

## Motivation

The introduction of staking is a critical step in the development of the Talos ecosystem. It provides a direct incentive for users to lock their $T, which in turn enhances the protocol's stability and allows for more strategic treasury management. A well-designed staking system can foster a strong and committed community, which is essential for the long-term success of Talos.

## Specification

### Initial Staking Implementation

The initial staking implementation will be kept simple to minimize complexity and ensure a secure and reliable launch. Staking will be facilitated through a smart contract where users can lock their $T.

**Key Features:**

*   **Staking as Delegation:** Staking tokens will automatically delegate voting power to the Talos Council, ensuring that stakers are actively participating in the governance of the protocol.
*   **Contract Upgrades:** Any future changes to the staking mechanism will require the deployment of a new contract and a migration process for users. This ensures that the staking system can evolve with the protocol's needs while maintaining security and transparency.

### Staking Rewards and APY

The staking rewards will be distributed in the form of $T. The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) will be managed dynamically to balance stakeholder rewards with the long-term health of the protocol.

**Initial APY:**

*   The initial APY will be managed dynamically from the start, with a target mean of 12.5%. This approach is designed to attract initial stakers while avoiding a fixed, high-inflationary APY. The dynamic model allows for adjustments based on real-time data, ensuring that the staking rewards are sustainable and aligned with the protocol's growth.

**Dynamic APY Guard:**

*   To protect the protocol during its early stages, a guard will be implemented to keep the APY from becoming unsustainably high. The APY will be capped at a maximum of 25% until the following conditions are met:
    *   The treasury is generating a consistent daily yield of over $30,000.
    *   At least 75% of the total $T supply is staked.

**Dynamic APR Calculation:**

*   The staking APR will be updated daily based on a composite metric that includes:
    *   **Treasury Performance:** The yield generated by the Talos treasury.
    *   **Market Data:** The current price behavior of $T and ETH.
    *   **Community Sentiment:** A measure of positive engagement and content related to Talos on social media platforms (e.g., Twitter).
*   This dynamic model aims to maintain a mean APR of approximately 12.5%, with adjustments made to reward stakers while preserving the stability of the token price. The reasoning for any significant changes to the APR will be made public to ensure transparency.

### Future Developments: Dividend-Style Rewards

While the initial focus will be on a traditional staking model, the long-term vision is to transition towards a system of irregular "dividends." This approach will detach staking from a fixed APY and instead reward stakers based on the protocol's performance and strategic decisions.

*   **Dividend Distributions:** When the protocol achieves strong and sustainable cash flow, and when there are no immediate high-value reinvestment opportunities, the council may decide to distribute a portion of the treasury's earnings to stakers. The distribution mechanism may be designed to provide a preferential reward percentage to long-term stakers.
*   **Non-$T Token Rewards:** These dividends may be distributed in non-$T tokens, providing stakers with a share of the real yield generated by the protocol.
*   **Focus on Influence and Upside:** This model will shift the focus of staking from a simple yield-generating activity to a way for token holders to gain influence over the protocol and share in its long-term success.

## Conclusion

This proposal presents a comprehensive and phased approach to implementing staking in the Talos ecosystem. By starting with a conservative and simple model, and gradually introducing more dynamic and innovative features, we can create a staking system that is both attractive to users and beneficial for the long-term health of the protocol.
